# gender_classification
This repository hosts the code for my initial image classification project, employing Support Vector Machines to classify gender as either male or female. The dataset can be acquired from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cashutosh/gender-classification-dataset. This resource is valuable for beginners venturing into image classification.
